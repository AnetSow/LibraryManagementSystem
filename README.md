# LibraryManagementSystem
Project from Designing Informatic Systems.

We were required to make script based on classes in Python3 (Object-Oriented Programming) used for libraries management. The project was motivated by the desire to understand inheritance and relations between classes and actions.

### Description

Our System keeps objects: title, copy, library, Librarian, Reader. 

Class title hold instances of titles and the instance's attributes.

Every Librarian has his own id, name, surname, titles_list. 

Librarian has more authority, consequently - different avaliable actions: adding/deleting title,  add/delete copy. Reader has it's own attributes (id, name, surname, pesel) and actions: borrow and return copy.

### Requirements
Python 3.7 

For more information: take a look on pipfile 

### Development
Project can be developed into fully functional System in the future.
